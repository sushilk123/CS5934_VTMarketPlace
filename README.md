**Virginia Tech MarketPlace** is a one stop shop for all VT students to buy and sell used items. It is designed specifically for the VT students to limit the user base and reinforce trust in transactions.
It is a platform where sellers can come together to sell their products or services to a curated customer base. Sellers have a place to gain visibility and sell their products, and the marketplace buyers can get the items at a cheaper and better price

**The Case for the System**

a. **Need for the system**

Currently there is no particular website for the Virginia tech students to buy and sell used products. By leveraging the VT Marketplace, it will be much easier for the VT students to search and buy the items of their choice without the hassle of going to YMCA or Walmart to buy items at a cheaper price.

b. **Who are the main stakeholders and end users?**

Virginia Tech Students and Staff

c. **If your system is an app, why does it have to be a mobile app (not a desktop ora web application)?**

In this project, we will focus on building a web application and the service having core features. And then as a future scope, we can expand it to the mobile application (IOS, Android) with additional features.

d. **Current market What are the other systems that have goals similar to yoursystem (mention some examples)?**

● BT Transit: Blacksburg Transit, better known as BT, is the public
transportation provider for Blacksburg. This service is very convenient for
students because they have a centralized app/website through which
they can check the bus schedule and onboard to the bus of their choice.


● VT Auction: Virginia Tech offers sale at Public Online Auction items of
VT Surplus Property. This sale is held online and facilitated by
Matthews Auctioneers. You will need to register on their website to bid
and pay.


● Facebook MarketPlace: This is the most popular online shopping mall
to sell/buy used(second-hand) items.

e. **What criticism do you have about them?**

● Current web based marketplace tools like Facebook marketplace rely
completely on trust between buyers and sellers. Hence, there is a need
for authentication for each transaction as people can make fake
accounts to conduct malicious activities.

● There are a large number of users, products, and product categories on
Facebook marketplace. This makes searching for required products
very difficult and time consuming.

● There is no restriction on how many postings an user can do on
Facebook marketplace. This fosters spamming of listings and
manipulation of search results.

● There is no secure payment gateway on Facebook marketplace.

f. **What is "new" about the system? Is it the idea, or is it the way itapproaches a solution that already exists?**

Our system is a web-based marketplace that specifically caters to the
needs of Virginia Tech students. It enhances the current web based
marketplace solutions by limiting user base, reinforcing trust and
authentication between them.

g. **How do you think your system will be different or better than existing products?**

○ Trust is established between the buyers and sellers by enabling
authentication based on the unique email ID provided to them.

○ To make searching for products efficient, every product is divided
into categories that are relevant to students(For ex. Furniture,
Books, Electric appliances etc.).

○ VT MarketPlace avoids spam of product listings and manipulation of search results by regulating seller postings.
